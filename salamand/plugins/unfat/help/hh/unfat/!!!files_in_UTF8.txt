All HTML help pages are in UTF8 encoding, so you must work with them only
in editor supporting UTF8. Moreover pages do not contain BOM, so UTF8 must
be selected manually in most of editors.

We recommend to use freeware text editor SciTE (http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/SciTE.html),
it will open all files in this directory in UTF8 automatically because this
is defined in SciTE.properties file.
