Builds of Altap Salamander
==========================


Internal Build (IB)
-------------------

It is build for internal use only. Only for development inside ALTAP's
office.


Developers Build (DB)
---------------------

This build is for plugin developers with access to ALTAP's CVS. They can
get current version of SHARED directory from CVS. After changes in SHARED
directory we release new DB to allow using new things in SDK.

Preview Build (PB)
------------------

Public preview build for testers. It contains TRACE messages and some other
support for debugging, so it is intended also for external plugin developers.

Custom Build (CB)
-----------------

Plugins are marked as CB whenever you build them (with any version of
SDK 2.53 or later or with SHARED directory from ALTAP's CVS for last
Developers Build (DB) version). We just want to differentiate versions
of plugins contained in ALTAP packages (release/beta/PB/DB versions)
and plugins which you have built yourself.
