How to Test DemoPlug
====================

Archiver (Packer/Unpacker):
DemoPlug is associated with *.dop archives. We have prepared one sample
dop archive, it's this file (content of this file is ignored, it's not
a real archive file). You can focus it and press Enter key to open it
and try to work with it as with any other archive file.

File Viewer:
Use View command (F3 key) on this file (*.dop is associated with DemoPlug).

Menu Extension:
Go to menu Plugins > DemoPlug. You can notice that some items are
disabled, this is test of menu item enablers (e.g. "File on Disk" item
is enabled only if focus in active panel is on some file on disk). See
also "Controls provided by Open Salamander" item, there are some special
dialog controls that we have implemented and you can use them in plugins.

File System:
You can open DemoPlug file system from Change Drive menu (Alt+F1 or Alt+F2
key), choose "DemoPlug FS" item. Or simply use Change Directory (Shift+F7
key) command. The name of DemoPlug file system is "DFS" (name is not
case-sensitive). You can try e.g. "dfs:c:\" to show path "c:\" in DFS.
WARNING: some operations in DFS are partially implemented (e.g. Copy), so
test DFS only on some not important files and directories.

Thumbnail Loader:
Switch to Thumbnails view mode (Alt+5 key). DemoPlug can make thumbnails
only for BMP files (you can test it on supplied sample.bmp file). You
should remove PictView from Plugins Manager because it makes thumbnails
for almost all picture files (including BMP), so DemoPlug's thumbnail
loader can be ignored (because BMP thumbnails are made by PictView). To
be sure that it is really DemoPlug what makes thumbnails you can try to
remove it from Plugins Manager (then thumbnails should disappear).
