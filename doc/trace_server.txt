How to use Altap Trace Server
=============================

Start Altap Trace Server (tserver.exe). You should start it before starting
Altap Salamander, because Altap Salamander connects to it at startup. SDK
and Preview Build (PB) versions of Altap Salamander can start Altap Trace
Server automatically when starting and Altap Trace Server is not running.
See window menu of Altap Salamander (click icon in top left corner of its
main window), Autostart Altap Trace Server command.

Altap Trace Server adds icon to system tray. You can open its window by
clicking on this icon. Several commands are also available in right-click
context menu on this icon.

You can close Altap Trace Server window using ESC or Alt+F4 or click on
Close button, but it does not end Altap Trace Server. If you want to end
Altap Trace Server, choose Exit command from menu Log.

Altap Trace Server can collect messages from many applications at once.
The default settings is to drop all messages when new process connects and
to activate Altap Trace Server whenever TRACE_E (error) message arrives.
See configuration in menu Options / Configuration for all options.

Altap Trace Server can open source file and focus the line with TRACE message
directly in MS Visual Studio 2008/2013/2015. If you want to enable this
feature, you need to add OpenEdit9 add-in to VS2008 or install OpenEdit12
extension to VS2013/VS2015. See how to do it later in this text. When add-in
is added or extension is installed, you can use Enter key or double click on
TRACE message (except on Message column) in Altap Trace Server to see it in
VS2008/VS2013/VS2015.

Adding OpenEdit9 add-in to VS2008: At first, you need to register it, go to
Start Menu, type "cmd.exe", right-click found "cmd.exe" and choose "Run As
Administrator". Go to tserver\openedit-vc2008 directory and run:
regsvr32 openedit9.dll. Add-in should be enabled by default, you can see it
in VS2008 in menu Tools / Add-ins Manager as "OpenEdit9 - Open Editor in VS".

Installing OpenEdit12 extension to VS2013/VS2015: go to tserver\openedit-vc2013
directory and run: openedit12.vsix. Select to which versions of VS you want
to install this extension (VS2013 and/or VS2015). You can see it in VS2013/VS2015
in menu Tools / Extensions and Updates as OpenEdit12.

If you have enabled "Exact Counter [ms]" column, you can see time between
focused TRACE message and all other TRACE messages with high precision.
Simply turn on/off this mode by pressing the Space key.

You can go to next or previous TRACE_E (error) message using Ctrl+Down / Ctrl+Up
arrows. Or to the first or last TRACE_E (error) message using Ctrl+Home /
Ctrl+End keys.


How to Uninstall Altap Trace Server
===================================

Altap Trace Server uses the following key in registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
Software\Altap\Trace Server. If you want to uninstall it, just remove this
key in registry, if you have registered OpenEdit9 add-in for VS2008, go to
tserver\openedit-vc2008 directory and run (open cmd.exe "as admin"):
regsvr32 /u openedit9.dll. If you have installed OpenEdit12 extension for
VS2013/VS2015, go to VS2013/VS2015 to menu Tools / Extensions and Updates,
find OpenEdit12, click on it and then click Uninstall button. And finally
remove tserver directory (with tserver.exe) from your disk.
